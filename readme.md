## 💻 Technical Details

The game uses several key components:

### Core Functions
- `Default()`: Game initialization
- `Draw()`: Console rendering
- `Input()`: Player input handling
- `Logic()`: Game mechanics
- `main()`: Game loop

### Key Features
- Double buffering for smooth rendering
- Dynamic speed adjustment
- Collision detection
- Coordinate tracking system

## 🔧 Customization

You can modify these constants in the code:
```cpp
const int width = 110;  // Game board width
const int heigth = 25;  // Game board height
```

## ANSI CODES
ANSI escape codes are supported on many modern terminal emulators (including Linux and macOS). They allow you to change the text color and background using special character sequences.

    \033[31;40m
1.  `\033` is the escape character (ESC in ASCII).
2. `31` represents red text color.
3. `40` represents black background color.
4. `0m` resets all attributes to default.

- \033[48;5;0m = Black background
- \033[48;5;1m = Red background
\033[48;5;2m = Green background
- \033[48;5;3m = Yellow background
- \033[48;5;4m = Blue background
- \033[48;5;5m = Magenta background
- \033[48;5;6m = Cyan background
- \033[48;5;7m = White background
- \033[48;5;<number>m = 256-color background (where <number> can be between 0 and 255)



## Text Color Setting Using ANSI codes

    "\033[31mThis text is red\033[0m"

1. `\033`: This starts the escape sequence.
2. `[31m`: This sets the text color to red.
3. `[0m:` This resets the color to default.
